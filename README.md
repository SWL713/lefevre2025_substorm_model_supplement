üõ∞ Model Overview
This study presents a dual-component empirical model for predicting auroral substorm onset timing in real time:

Loading Function (Lf) ‚Äî Modified from Newell et al. (2007) with a reduced clock angle exponent (sin^(1/3)(Œ∏/2)) to better capture onset delays under moderate IMF orientations.

Response Function (Rf) ‚Äî Dynamic scaling factor derived from event-specific Cs constants as a function of coupling strength (XDst = V¬∑|Bz| / 100). Exhibits a two-regime structure with a threshold at XDst ‚âà ‚Äì75.

The model achieves:

Mean absolute error: ~18 minutes

Standard deviation: ~13 minutes

N = 60 substorm events (2001‚Äì2025)

Robust performance under weak and transitional coupling conditions, where traditional models tend to fail.

üîç Reproducibility Notes
All formulas for Lf, Cs, Rf, and timing error are embedded in LeFevre Substorm Model - Full Dataset with calculations.xlsx and can be reviewed or modified directly.

Event timing determinations are based on GOES magnetometer Hp traces following the methodology in Section 2.2 of the manuscript.

XDst threshold of ‚Äì75 separates weak and strong coupling regimes for Rf fitting.
